# AHK-Windows general stuff
This is my collection of AutoHotkey scripts that I use every day that add things to Windows.

# RCtrl multi key.ahk
This makes Right Control do a lot of things. Here is a list of things that happen if you hold it:

- Change volume and play/pause with the scroll wheel
- (to add) WASD are arrow keys
- (to fix) not a feature, but I need to fix that there is a limit to the ammount of hotkeys activated per second and my G502 mouse can reach that limit.

# KDE style window dragging.ahk *made by ck, thinkstorm, Chris and Aurelian in the AHK forums*
This adds a cool Linux thing in many desktop environments that makes, in this case the Alt key, move and resize windows without aiming for the borders, as it works in any place inside the window.

- Alt + Left Button: move window
- Alt + Right Button: resize window from the closest corner
- Double-Alt + Left Button   : minimize window
- Double-Alt + Right Button  : maximize/restore window
- Double-Alt + Middle Button : close window
