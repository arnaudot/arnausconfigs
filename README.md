# Arnau's Configs
This repository is a collection of my configuration files, scripts, macros, everything that I use on a daily basis.
I don't recommend that you use every config file because that is tailored to my muscle memory and might not work well for you, but I totally recommend you checking out some of my AutoHotkey scripts.
Not everything is made by me, but the majority is. Credits will be written where they belong.

## AHK-Windows general stuff
This are my AutoHotkey scripts that add some missing functionality to Windows, like holding Alt to move a window without aiming for the borders. It's all small things that add up hugely to a better experience using Windows. For more info on the scripts that I use, open that folder and check them out!

## Things that I want to add to this repo
- Macros and hotkeys for DaVinci Resolve, my video editor of choice
- More Windows script stuff
- Configuration files
- The list of apps that I need on some devices.
